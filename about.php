				<p class="font-text">
					OPC was formed in 1992 and is now one of UL's biggest clubs.The OPC's main goal is to spark the interest 
					of our activities and to continue to develop the skills needed for those activities. We offer regular 
					training for Caving, Climbing and Orienteering and major training for Mountaineering before international 
					trips to Scotland, the Alps, and beyond! Head to 
					<a href="https://ulwolves.ie/club/outdoor-pursuits" target="_blank">ULWolves.ie</a>
					to sign up and see some of our upcoming events!
				</p>
				<p class="font-text">
					Our Sunday trips are usually either hiking or rock climbing and no prior experience is needed. 
					Just bring your boots and some waterproofs and you will be ready to go. For the rock climbing trips 
					we supply all the gear including rock shoes, helmets and harnesses. On these Sunday trips you get a 
					great opportunity to learn map skills or belaying and climbing techniques.

				<p class="font-text">
					Hiking is one of the most active sports in the OPC, with a hike taking place almost every Sunday and hikes on all 
					of our weekend trips. They are a great place to meet other club members, enjoy some of the beautiful Irish countryside 
					and of course be active! Our fantastic hike leaders are there to help you out and if you have any questions at all 
					please email us	on <span class="text-primary">tripsulopc@gmail.com</span>. See you out there!

				<h4 class="font-title" id="rockClimbing">Rock Climbing</h4>
				<p class="font-text">
					Climbing is among the most addictive and exhilarating sports in the OPC. We have our on campus 
					bouldering wall open every Monday Tuesday and Thursday from 7-10pm aswell as weekly trips to suas 
					climbing centre on Tuesdays. The wall is a fantastic place to meet like minded people and make life 
					long friends. Our more experienced members are also always on hand to help you improve. Outdoor 
					climbing trips are dotted throughout the semester and usually take place on Sundays. We even run 3 
					international climbing trips a year. If you have any questions at all please email <span class="text-primary">tripsulopc@gmail.com</span>.

				<h4 class="font-title" id="orienteering">Orienteering</h4>
				<p class="font-text">
					Orienteering is a competitive international sport that combines running with navigation. Its a timed race 
					where you use a specially created, highly detailed map to find control points. The course difficulties are 
					set to accommodate people of all abilities. Its a fun and unique way to experience the beauty of the Irish landscape.

				<h4 class="font-title" id="caving">Caving</h4>
				<p class="font-text">
					Caving is an exhilerating way to see what Ireland has to offer. Few people see this part of the country, 
					it's another world down there. We have regular single rope technique (SRT) training nights throughout 
					the semester in preparation for caving, which is a great way to learn and meet some brilliant people 
					while doing so.
